This project implements a Java-based web interface for a user study aimed to evaluate different location-aware music recommendation techniques. The system uses five alternative approaches to select a music track that matches a place of interest (a POI) visited by a tourist.

To determine which approach produces music recommendations most appreciated by the users, a web-based interface collects the users' subjective assessments on whether a music track suits a POI. The participants of the experiment are repeatedly asked to consider a POI and while looking at its images and description, to listen to selected music tracks. The user is asked to check all the tracks that in her opinion suit that POI.

During each evaluation step, the music recommendations for a POI are selected using the proposed five approaches: a personalized baseline approach and four context-aware approaches. The order of the recommendations is randomized, and the user is not aware of the algorithms that are used to generate the recommendations. In total, a maximum of five tracks corresponding to the top-ranked tracks given by each approach are suggested for each POI, but sometimes less tracks are shown as the tracks selected by the different approaches may overlap.

Note that the implementation of the recommendation algorithms is not implemented in Java. Instead, the ranked lists of recommendations for each approach are loaded using Python scripts and stored in a MySQL database. The Python scripts are availble in the /scripts directory.
